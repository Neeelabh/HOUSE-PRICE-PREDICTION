# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION

# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to predict real estate prices based on several features like location, size, total square footage, number of bathrooms, and more. Using a dataset of properties, the model applies various preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict property prices. The main objective is to help users estimate the value of real estate properties based on available data.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- **numpy**: For numerical computations
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization
- **joblib**: For saving and loading models

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
    - Drop unnecessary columns (`area_type`, `availability`, `society`, `balcony`).
    - Handle missing values in relevant columns like `bath` and `size`.

2. **Feature Engineering**
    - Convert non-numeric data to numeric.
    - Normalize the `total_sqft` column.
    - Create dummy variables for categorical data such as `location`.

3. **Model Training**
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Use various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) for predicting real estate prices.
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.

4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Fine-tune the models using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
    - Compare the models based on accuracy and error metrics.

5. **Results Visualization**
    - Visualize important features influencing the property prices.
    - Plot residuals to evaluate the model's predictive capabilities.
